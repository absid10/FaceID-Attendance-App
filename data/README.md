# Data folder

This folder contains CSV files used by the app.

- `Attendance.csv`: Attendance log (repo contains a sanitized template/example only)
- `UserDetails.csv`: Registered users (repo contains a sanitized template/example only)
- `EnrollmentRequests.csv`: Requests submitted via the UI

## Privacy

Do not commit real attendance logs, real names, or any biometric/face data to Git.
Use `data/private/` (git-ignored) for local copies if you need backups.
