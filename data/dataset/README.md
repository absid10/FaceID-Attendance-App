# Dataset folder

This folder is where face images captured during enrollment are stored (e.g. `User.<id>.<n>.jpg`).

## Important

The repository intentionally does **not** include any real face images.
- Face images are biometric personal data.
- They also make the repo very large very quickly.

Keep your local images here, train a model locally, and distribute the app/exe without committing this dataset.
